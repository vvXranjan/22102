### Binary Search (Recursive and Iterative)
**Theory:**
- Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array.

- The time complexity of binary search is O(log n).

**Viva Questions:**
1. What is binary search and how does it work?
   - Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and narrows down the search space by half based on the comparison.
2. What is the time complexity of binary search?
   - The time complexity of binary search is O(log n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
3. Can you explain the difference between recursive and iterative binary search?
   - Recursive binary search uses a recursive function to divide the search space, while iterative binary search uses a loop.
4. What is the base case for the recursive binary search algorithm?
   - The base case is when the search space becomes empty, indicating that the element is not present in the array.

2. What is the worst-case time complexity of quick sort?
   - The worst-case time complexity of quick sort is O(n^2) when the pivot selection leads to unbalanced partitions.
3. How can you improve the pivot selection in quick sort?
